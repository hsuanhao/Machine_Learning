    "# Compress Image\n",
    "\n",
    "In this exercise, I implement the **K-means clustering algorithm** and apply it to **compress an image**. I will first start on an example 2D dataset that will help us gain an intuition of how the K-means algorithm works. After this, I will use the K-means algorithm for image compression by reducing the number of colors occuring in an image to only those most common in that image. In this work, I mainly use **MATLAB/Octave** to write codes. "
