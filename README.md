# Machine Learning/ Deep Learning

In this repository, I mainly put reports for data analysis I have done by using different statistical models and algorithms in machine learning or deep learning. I wrote my own codes in MATLAB/Octave and Python to finish these jobs.

## Supervised Learning
1. [Prediction profits for a food truck](https://github.com/hsuanhao/Machine_Learning/blob/master/prediction_profits_food_truck.ipynb) (linear regression)
2. [Prediction of housing price](https://github.com/hsuanhao/Machine_Learning/blob/master/prediction_housing_price.ipynb) (linear regresion)
3. [Recognize hand-written digits (from 0 to 9)](https://github.com/hsuanhao/Machine_Learning/blob/master/Hand-Written_Digits_Recognition.ipynb) (logistic regression -- multiclassification)
4. Image Recogonition (under construction) (logistic regression -- binary classification)
5. Spam Classification (under construction)

## Unsupervised Learning
1. Image Compression (under construction)
2. Detect failing servers on a network (under construction)
3. Recommender systems for movies (under construction)
