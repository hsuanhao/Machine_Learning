# Machine Learning/ Deep Learning

In this repository, I mainly put reports for data analysis I have done by using different statistical models and algorithms in machine learning or deep learning. I wrote my own codes in MATLAB/Octave and Python to finish these jobs.

I also use useful libraries in Python, such as NumPy (for vectorization calculation), Pandas (for data manipulation and analysis), SciPy (for scientific computing), Matplotlib (for plotting), and sckit-learn (for machine learning). Besides, PySpark is for parallel computing in distributed file system for big data, and it has its own machine learning library such as MLLib and ML packages. 

## Supervised Learning
- [Prediction profits for a food truck](https://github.com/hsuanhao/Machine_Learning/blob/master/prediction_profits_food_truck.ipynb) (linear regression)
- [Prediction of housing price](https://github.com/hsuanhao/Machine_Learning/blob/master/prediction_housing_price.ipynb) (linear regresion)
3. [Recognize hand-written digits (from 0 to 9)](https://github.com/hsuanhao/Machine_Learning/blob/master/Hand-Written_Digits_Recognition.ipynb) (logistic regression -- multiclassification)
4. [Image Recogonition](https://github.com/hsuanhao/Machine_Learning/blob/master/Image_Recognition.ipynb) (logistic regression -- binary classification)
5. Prediction of Trends in Atmospheric Carbon Dioxide (Time Series) (under construction)
6. Spam Classification (under construction)

## Unsupervised Learning
1. Image Compression (under construction)
2. Detect failing servers on a network (under construction)
3. Recommender systems for movies (under construction)
