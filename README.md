# Machine Learning #

In this repository, I mainly put selected reports for data analysis I have done by using different statistical models and algorithms in **machine learning** or **deep learning**. I wrote my own codes in MATLAB/Octave and Python to finish these jobs.

I also use useful libraries in Python, such as **NumPy** (for vectorization calculation), **Pandas** (for data manipulation and analysis), **SciPy** (for scientific computing), **Matplotlib** (for plotting), and **sckit-learn** (for machine learning). 

## Supervised Learning ##
- [Prediction profits for a food truck](https://github.com/hsuanhao/Machine_Learning/blob/master/prediction_profits_food_truck.ipynb) (**linear regression**, **MATLAB**)
- [Prediction of housing price](https://github.com/hsuanhao/Machine_Learning/blob/master/prediction_housing_price.ipynb) (**linear regresion** with multiple variables, **MATLAB**)
- [Recognize hand-written digits (from 0 to 9)](https://github.com/hsuanhao/Machine_Learning/blob/master/Hand-Written_Digits_Recognition.ipynb) (Multiclassification by **Neural Network**, **MATLAB**)
- [Recognize hand-written digits (from 0 to 9)](https://github.com/hsuanhao/Machine_Learning/blob/master/Nearest_neighbor_MNIST.ipynb) (Multiclassification by **Nearest Neighbor**, **Python**)
- [Image Recogonition](https://github.com/hsuanhao/Machine_Learning/blob/master/Image_Recognition.ipynb) (**logistic regression** -- binary classification, **Python**)
- [Spine Injury Classification](https://github.com/hsuanhao/Machine_Learning/blob/master/Spine_Injury_Classification.ipynb) (Multiclassification by **Nearest Neighbor**, **Python**)

## Unsupervised Learning ##
- [Image Compression](https://github.com/hsuanhao/Machine_Learning/blob/master/Image_Compression.ipynb) (clustering by **K-means algorithm**, **MATLAB**)
- Dimension Reduction for MNIST data set of handwritten digits (**Principal Component Analysis**, or **PCA**, **Python**)
- Detect failing servers on a network (**Anomaly Detection Algorithm**)
- [Recommender systems for movies](https://github.com/hsuanhao/Machine_Learning/blob/master/Recommender_Systerms_for_Movies.ipynb) (**Collaborative Filtering Algorithm**, **MATLAB**)


# Statistics #

In what follows, I selected some coursework in statistics by using **R**.
