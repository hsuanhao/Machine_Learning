This dataset consists of ratings on a scale of 1 to 5. Also, if users did not give rating on movies, the ratings are assigned to 0. The dataset has $n_u = 943$ users, and $n_m = 1682$ movies. \n",

The matrix `R` is an binary-valued indicator matrix, where $R(i,j) = 1$ if user $j$ gave a rating to movie $i$, or $R(i,j)=0$. The goal of collaborative filtering is to predict movie ratings for the movies that users have not yet rated, that is, the entries with $R(i,j)=0$. This can allow us to recommend the movies with the highest predicted ratings to the user.\n",
